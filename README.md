▪ IoT Smart Fan

![IoT Smart Fan](/IoT Smart Fan.png)

* Develop an IoT system using Arduino Uno, DHT11 sensor, LM35 sensor, 16x2 LCD, and a small fan module.

* Implement serial communication between Arduino and a Raspberry Pi (on a virtual machine) for data storage and conditional automation based on temperature thresholds using C++ and Python.

* Create a PHP-based User Interface on the Raspberry Pi to display real-time sensor data and analysis features.

▪ Home Security - Smart Door

* Design a smart door system using ESP32 (with C++) for password verification and servo lock control; integrated with Raspberry Pi (with Python) for database management and access logging via ThingSpeak using MQTT and HTTP protocols.

* Develop a PHP web interface on Raspberry Pi to manage passwords and monitor access logs with real-time updates and visualizations from ThingSpeak.
